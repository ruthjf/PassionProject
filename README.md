# Passion Project: foodpad

## Summary

Foodpad is a recipe-sharing application where users can browse through recipes as well as store and share their own recipes. My idea is to create a simple application that stores recipes and works like an online memo pad.

## Details

- Foodpad features a many-to-many relationship between Recipes and Ingredients.
- Users are able to browse through posted recipes (Read).
- Admin are able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on both entities.
- Users are able to an upload image of their recipe.
  
## Future Updates/Fixes

- [ ] Fix bug to be able to show recipe image in List
- [ ] Add more values to Ingredient entity (e.g. Quantity of the ingredient)
- [ ] Add a User entity and display associated recipes
- [ ] Refine layout, CSS and accessibility
